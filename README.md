## Introduction

Autocorrect is a common feature in text processing applications. This project demonstrates how to build an autocorrect system using NLP techniques in Python. The system takes a misspelled word as input and suggests the correct word based on a large corpus of text.

## Features

- Tokenization of text data
- Calculation of word probabilities
- Implementation of the Levenshtein distance for spelling correction
- Suggestion of the most likely correct word

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
